All of those little lights in the sky
They only stick your feet to the ground
You'd better keep your head down
All of this little dreams in your mind
They only make you wonder why
When you wake up you start to cry
When you come home you just want to die

There was a time you seemed to be fine
You were a rock when you were a child
Waiting for the turn of the tide
You thought the stars were sending you love
How come you never wondered why
When you came home, you started to cry
When you woke up, you wanted to die

All of this little lights in the sky
If you can make them fall you will rise
Just in the nick of time
I thought I could be able to find
Something to save all I left behind
But as I grew up I changed my mind
And only remained the stars in the sky

With your innocence fly by
