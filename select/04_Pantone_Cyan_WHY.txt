I want to pallet the neon sky
And squeeze the pigment from the most electric autumn leaves
And neighborhood, not play the fischer-price
Or inch-born weeble in my very own street scene
Fall diorama

And id forgotten even the most beautiful straight haired hyde park honey
On the hot seat high school bus

I want to pallet the neon sky
And squeeze the pigment from the most electric autumn leaves

Pantone cyan,
Pantone cyan,
Pantone cyan,
Pantone cyan.
