This hybrid city in love
With the UFO's
Arms down and still as a stick
You stand for the UFO's
I REMEMBER WHEN
YOU SAID THEY WERE'NT REAL
LOOKS LIKE YOU WERE RIGHT AFTER ALL
This hybrid city in love
For a fantacy I want to live
If truly believe it
Then yes it is
Their eyes will see these things too
Their eyes will see these things
And not just you
I REMEMBER WHEN
YOU TRIED TO CONVINCE ME
THAT YOU WERE AN ABDUCTEE
THIS HAPPENED LAST YEAR
I KNOW YOU FEEL NUMB
THEY KNOW YOU FEEL NOTHING AT ALL
IS THERE NO AUTHORITY
I'VE SEEN ALL I NEED TO SEE
