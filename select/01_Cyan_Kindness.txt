The news is too a new future
The accident at the door
We their by accident and then by accident
The rhythm comes and run
The music and the seels to planet
I wanted to towards the sky
To enough to every sign 'till the end of time.
Baby, come and run

Cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan!

Sometimes been again to fired up
Our hearts are till the sky
Our hearts are taking on till my eyes is done
Baby, it's alright
It casts the music ever else
Down to every bridge
But I could take this on, leave the rest behind
To the end of day!
Cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan, cyan!
